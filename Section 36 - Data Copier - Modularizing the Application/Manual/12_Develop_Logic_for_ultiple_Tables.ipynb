    "* For now we will pass the comma separated string as run time argument. It can be accessed using `sys` module.\n",
    "* Once the list of tables is passed as comma separated string, we need to do the following:\n",
    "  * Split the comma separated string into a list of tables.\n",
    "  * Iterate through the list and invoke the logic to read from file and write to the table for each item in the list.\n",
    "  * We will also modularize to make sure we have a function which will read and write for a table which is passed as argument.\n"
