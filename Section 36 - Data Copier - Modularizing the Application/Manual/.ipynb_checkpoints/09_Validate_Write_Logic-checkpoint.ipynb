    "As we have developed the function to write Dataframe to Postgres database table along with test logic, it is time for us to validate.\n",
    "* We can validate either by using Pycharm Run Configurations or Python command using CLI.\n",
    "* Here are the steps using Pycharm Run Configurations.\n",
    "  * Run the application to create configuration under run. Ignore any errors.\n",
    "  * Set the required environment variables under run configuration of the application.\n",
    "  * Run the application using Pycharm run option.\n",

    "  * Connect to the database and validate data in the users table.\n",
    "* Here are the steps using Python command as part of CLI.\n",
    "  * Set required environment variables (on Windows we need to use `$env` and on Mac or Linux we need to use `export` command).\n",
    "  * Run the program using `python write.py`.\n",
    "  * Review the output to confirm if the data is loaded successfully or not.\n",
    "  * Connect to the database and validate data in the users table. We should see duplicate records in the table as we loaded same data twice.\n"
