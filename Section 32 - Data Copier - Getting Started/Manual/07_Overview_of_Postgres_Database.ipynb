    "## Overview of Postgres\n",
    "Let us get a quick overview of Postgres Database.\n",
    "* Postgres is multi tenant database server. It means there can be multiple databases per server.\n",
    "* We typically create databases and users then grant different types of permissions for different users.\n",
    "* Here are the details about our database:\n",
    "  * Database Name: **retail_db**\n",
    "  * Database User: **retail_user**\n",
    "  * Permissions: **ALL** (DDL, DML, Queries)\n",
    "* Login to the system or Docker container where Postgres is running. In my case I am connecting to Docker container.\n",
    "```shell script\n",
    "docker exec \\\n",
    "  -it retail_pg \\\n",
    "  bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Login to Postgres Database\n",
    "```shell script\n",
    "psql -U retail_user \\\n",
    "  -d retail_db  \\\n",
    "  -W\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Let us create additional table with 2 fields.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE t (\n",
    "  i INT,\n",
    "  s VARCHAR(10)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "* CRUD Operations (DML)\n",
    "  * C - Create -> INSERT\n",
    "  * R - Read -> Querying using SELECT\n",
    "  * U - Update -> UPDATE\n",
    "  * D - Delete -> DELETE\n",
    "  * CRUD Operations are achieved using Data Manipulation Language (DML).\n",
    "  * Syntax with respect DML Statements is same with most of the RDBMS Databases.\n",
    "* Let us insert data into the table.\n",
    "  * Inserting one row at a time.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 'Hello');\n",
    "INSERT INTO t VALUES (2, 'World');\n",
    "SELECT * FROM t;\n",
    "```\n",
    "  * Inserting multiple rows at a time (bulk insert or batch insert)\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO t VALUES \n",
    "    (1, 'Hello'),\n",
    "    (2, 'World');\n",
    "SELECT * FROM t;\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Let us update data in the table.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE t SET s = lower(s);\n",
    "SELECT * FROM t;\n",
    "UPDATE t SET s = 'Hello' WHERE s = 'hello';\n",
    "SELECT * FROM t;\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Let us delete data from the table.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM t WHERE s = 'Hello';\n",
    "SELECT * FROM t;\n",
    "DELETE FROM t; -- Deletes all the data from a given table.\n",
    "SELECT * FROM t;\n",
    "```\n",
    "* We can also clean up the whole table using DDL Statement. `TRUNCATE` is faster to clean up the data compared to `DELETE` with out conditions.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE t;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM t;\n",
    "```\n",
    "* We can drop the table using `DROP` Command.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE t;\n",
    "```\n",
    "* SQL Commands starts with `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE`, `DROP` etc are called as Data Definition Language or DDL Commands."
