    "## Managing Dependencies\n",
    "Let us see how we can manage dependencies for Python Projects.\n",
    "* We use Pip to manage dependencies for Python based Projects.\n",
    "* Here is the typical life cycle.\n",
    "  * Search for Python libraries using [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org).\n",
    "  * One can install directly using `pip install` Command. For example `pip install configparser`.\n",
    "  * To overcome compatibility issues, we need to decide on versions.\n",
    "  * We can also pass version of the library to `pip install` command. For example `pip install configparser==5.0.0`.\n",
    "* For projects we keep track of all the external libraries using a text file - e.g. **requirements.txt**.\n",
    "* We can add libraries to our project using **requirements.txt**. For example, here we are adding Pandas to our project.\n",
    "```text\n",
    "pandas==1.3.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "* We will take care of other libraries later.\n",
    "* Once libraries are defined as part of **requirements.txt**, we can run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "* We can also uninstall all the libraries using relevant command."
