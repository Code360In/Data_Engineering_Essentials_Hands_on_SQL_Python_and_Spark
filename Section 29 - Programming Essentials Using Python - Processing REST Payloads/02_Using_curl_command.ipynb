    "Let us understand how we can use curl command to place REST requests to get the response from the external applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `curl` is available in almost all operating sytems. It is a command which can be leveraged to talk to external applications via REST APIs.\n",
    "   * We can make make all standard REST APIs calls using `curl`.\n",
    "   * At time we have to get authenticated or authorized to use REST APIs calls and for that we typically have to pass tokens as part of headers.\n",
    "   * We can use `curl` when authenticated or authorized is required. We need to understand how to pass tokens or credentials while using `curl` command.\n",
    "   * We can pass any request type (such as GET, POST, etc) to `curl`. The default is `GET`.\n",
    "   * Here is an example of simple `GET` using `curl`."
